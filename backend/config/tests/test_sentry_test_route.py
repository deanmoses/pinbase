"""Tests for ``/api/sentry_test`` — the staff-gated exception trigger.

The route exists to verify the Sentry pipeline end-to-end (see
ObservabilityArchitecture.md § First-event verification). These tests
pin both the authz gate and the actual capture behavior so a future
change that breaks either is a CI failure, not a silent regression
discovered the next time someone runs the verification step.
