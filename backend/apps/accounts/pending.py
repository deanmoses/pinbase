"""Pre-signup pending-session helpers.

After a successful WorkOS callback for a brand-new user we don't have a
local `User` row yet — the user still has to pick a handle. The WorkOS-side
identity (workos_user_id, email, name) is stashed in the Django session
under `PENDING_SESSION_KEY` and the user is redirected to `/signup`. The
onboarding endpoints (`/pending`, `/check`, `/submit`, `/cancel`) read or
clear this payload.

Server-side sessions are already in use for the OAuth `state` round-trip,
so this doesn't put PII in a browser cookie.
