    Two distinct impersonation attacks need different handling, and the
    same digit (`0` / `1`) is ambiguous between them:

    - **Padding**: appending or prepending digits to a reserved word —
      `admin99`, `flip2024`, `999admin`. Edge digit runs are stripped
      wholesale so the residue equals the reserved root.
    - **Homoglyphs**: substituting a letter-shaped digit interior to a
      word — `m0derator`, `flipc0mmons`. After edge stripping, remaining
      digits are folded via `_HOMOGLYPHS`; only `0` and `1` are credible
      letter-substitutes, so other interior digits fall through to the
      non-letter strip.

    Finally, anything still non-letter (hyphens, underscores, residual
    digits) is dropped so hyphenation variants like `flip-commons` fold
    to the same residue as the canonical entry.
