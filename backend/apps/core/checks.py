"""System checks for project-wide contracts.

Run via ``manage.py check`` (model-contract checks also run at server
boot via Django's startup ``system_checks()``). Production-only checks
are gated with ``deploy=True`` and run under ``manage.py check --deploy``
— Railway's ``preDeployCommand`` includes this, so they surface in
deploy logs. Errors block the deploy; Warnings are logged but
non-blocking. See each check function's docstring for its specific
