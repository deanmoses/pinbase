# and VERIFICATION for the same reason: an unverified non-author trying
# to undo someone else's changeset should hear "not yours," not "verify
# your email" — verifying won't grant ownership. OWNER sits below ROLE
# so a future moderator-override path (if ever added) can still surface
# "moderator only" copy when relevant. EXPERIENCE sits below VERIFICATION

# N edits) — an unverified user with too few edits should hear "verify
