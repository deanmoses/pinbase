"""System checks for ``policy_activities`` declarations on Ninja schemas.

Verified at ``manage.py check`` (and at server boot) so a schema/activity
mispairing crashes early instead of producing a wrong verdict on the
wire — which is the worst place for it.

A schema declares the target-aware activities whose verdicts it embeds
via a ``ClassVar[tuple[Activity, ...]]`` named ``policy_activities``
(``list`` is also accepted, but ``tuple`` is the convention — the
declaration is static and immutable in spirit). This check walks every
ninja ``Schema`` subclass and asserts:

- each listed activity is registered;
- each listed activity is ``target_aware=True`` (a target-less verdict
  belongs on ``AuthStatusSchema.capabilities``, not on a row);
- the schema declares ``policy_target_model: ClassVar[type[Model]]``
  (required — plain ninja Schemas don't expose their underlying model
  otherwise, and the structural check is the *point* of this system
  check; making it opt-in would let a schema author silently skip it);
- every Protocol attribute the registered ``target`` requires must
  exist on the declared model.

Structural Protocol-vs-model conformance is a presence check by design
— if the schema author got the wrong activity onto the wrong schema, the
named-attribute mismatch is the coarse smoke that catches it. The real
safety is the schema author explicitly typing the list.
