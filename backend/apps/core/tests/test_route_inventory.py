"""Route-inventory test: every mutating route is gated or explicitly public.

Walks every Ninja router in the project and asserts every mutating
operation carries exactly one of:

    @requires(Activity.X)        — the canonical gate; enforced at request time.
    @gated_inline(Activity.X)    — view body calls policy.check() itself.
    @public_mutation(reason)     — deliberately ungated; reason captured.

A mutating route with no marker (or with two) fails the test. There is
no allowlist file — every exception is the @public_mutation decorator
at the view, where the reason lives next to the route.
