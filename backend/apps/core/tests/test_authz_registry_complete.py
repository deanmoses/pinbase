"""Asserts every Activity has a registered rule at startup.

This test deliberately does NOT use the `isolated_registry` fixture.
It reads the real, app-`ready()`-populated registry and would pass
trivially against an empty one.

A new `Activity` enum member with no per-app rule registration is what
this catches: the runtime would `LookupError` instead of returning a
permission decision, which is correct but only useful if someone hits
the route. This test makes that misconfiguration a CI failure.

       anonymous would let logged-out users through, and the SPA
