"""Attach per-request Sentry scope data: user (id+username) and tags.

Sits after ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` so ``request.user`` is resolved.
For authenticated requests the scope carries the user's id and username;
for anonymous requests no user is attached. Tags (``auth_state``,
``ua_family``) are set on every request so the issue stream is
filterable for both anonymous and authenticated traffic — see
ObservabilityArchitecture.md § Kept fields.

The ``{id, username}`` keep-list is **load-bearing** for the privacy
contract. There is no ``before_send`` scrubber to catch a mistake here
— the only other safeguards are ``send_default_pii=False`` (which
prevents ``DjangoIntegration`` from auto-attaching the email) and
Sentry's server-side scrubbing rules. Adding ``user.email`` or
``user.ip_address`` to the ``set_user`` call below ships them. The
test ``test_authenticated_user_has_no_email_or_ip_in_scope`` is the
regression guard; do not weaken it.

Relies on ``DjangoIntegration``'s per-request scope isolation: each
incoming request gets a fresh scope, so the user/tags set here don't
leak into the next request.

    self-identified crawlers (``"bot"``, ``"crawl"``, ``"spider"``,

    ``"fetch"``, ``"curl"``, ``"wget"``) — node-fetch, python-

    don't carry those substrings.
