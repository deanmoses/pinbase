"""API schemas for the provenance app.

Used by api.py and the page-oriented changes endpoints (page_endpoints.py).

Claim payloads are stored as JSON (``Claim.value`` is a ``JSONField``), so
the ``raw`` field of :class:`ClaimValueSchema` (used wherever a claim
value crosses the wire — ``old_value`` / ``new_value`` / ``value``) is
typed as ``object``: it carries scalars, dicts, lists, or null depending
on the claim kind, and the catalog-level schema is what actually
constrains each field's shape.

    ``state`` (see :data:`ClaimDisplayIdentityState`) discriminates three cases that
    frontends typically want to render differently:

    - ``"resolved"``: the backend produced a real label; ``label`` is the
      non-empty user-facing string.
    - ``"deleted"``: the claim references an FK target row that no longer
      exists in the catalog (e.g. a Person was removed after the claim
      was made). Legitimate runtime condition; ``label`` is null.
    - ``"missing"``: the claim dict didn't carry this identity key at
      all — an invariant violation that validation should have prevented.
      Backend logs loudly when this happens; ``label`` is null.

    No default on ``state``: every construction must pick one. Defaulting
