# node:*-slim variants ship without ca-certificates. Node's own HTTPS uses
# its bundled CA roots and works fine, but tools that shell out to the OS
# trust store (notably sentry-cli, invoked by sentrySvelteKit during
# sourcemap upload) fail TLS verification with "unable to get local issuer
# certificate" against ingest endpoints. Install ca-certificates so any
# such tool can reach the public internet over HTTPS.

# Copy source and build. RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA is auto-injected by Railway
# for GitHub-triggered deploys; it stamps the SvelteKit build version so open
# browser tabs can detect a new deploy via version.json polling. Outside
# Railway the ARG falls back to "dev" and polling is disabled.

# Sentry sourcemap upload happens during `pnpm build` (sentrySvelteKit
# plugin). The plugin's autoUploadSourceMaps gate in vite.config.ts is
# truthy only when all three of these are non-empty, so without them the
# build silently skips the upload and browser stack traces stay
# minified in production. Multi-stage Docker doesn't inherit host env
# vars into build stages; Railway passes service-scoped vars as build
# args, but only for ARGs the Dockerfile declares — hence the explicit
# declarations here. Defaults are empty so local/CI Docker builds without
# Sentry secrets still succeed (the upload just no-ops).
