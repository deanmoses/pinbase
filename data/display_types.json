    "description": "Score reels are mechanical rotating drums, each one displaying a single digit — zero through nine — painted on its face and driven by a solenoid one click at a time. To show a score of 47,300, five separate reels would spin to their correct positions, each advancing with a satisfying mechanical clunk. When a player rolled the score past 99,990 points, the reels would quietly cycle back to zero and start again.\n\nGottlieb introduced the first practical score reel displays in the late 1940s, and they became the universal standard for the electromechanical era. Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb each developed their own reel assemblies, usually six digits arranged across the backglass and visible through the painted artwork. The arrangement of those reels — and the artwork designed around them — became part of each machine's visual identity.\n\nThe reel's sound is inseparable from the character of EM pinball: the rapid-fire clicking of bumper hits accumulating, the slow deliberate turn of a bonus reel advancing one hundred points at a time, the satisfying final clunk when a thousand-point shot lands. When solid-state electronics arrived in the late 1970s and alphanumeric LED displays made reels obsolete, many players mourned the loss of that sound as much as anything else."

    "description": "Before mechanical score reels became affordable and reliable enough for universal use, many early electromechanical machines tracked scores using banks of illuminated bulbs mounted behind the backglass. Each bulb corresponded to a fixed point value — 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000 — and the total visible on the glass was simply the sum of whatever bulbs happened to be lit. Artists designed the backglass paintings around these fixed positions, weaving the scoring indicators into the overall composition.\n\nThe backglass light system was elegantly simple: a relay closed, a circuit completed, a bulb lit. No moving parts beyond the relay itself. This simplicity made it cheap to build and easy to repair, though it limited scoring precision and made it impossible to display a running numeric total the way score reels could. Players had to mentally add up the lit positions to know where they stood.\n\nThis display style represents a transitional moment in pinball's evolution — more sophisticated than the pure passive scoring pockets of the pre-electric era, but not yet the mechanically complex reel-based displays that would define the EM golden age. A small number of machines continued using backglass light scoring even after reels became commonplace, typically in budget-tier or novelty designs where manufacturing cost was the overriding concern."

    "description": "When solid-state electronics made mechanical score reels obsolete in the late 1970s, the first generation of digital displays were simple seven-segment LEDs — capable of showing numbers and a handful of blocky letters, glowing amber or red against the darkened backbox. By the early 1980s, manufacturers had moved to sixteen-segment displays that could render the full alphabet with reasonable clarity. For the first time, a pinball machine could speak.\n\nBally and Williams used alphanumeric displays extensively throughout the 1980s and into 1991, when plasma dot-matrix displays took over. Machines could now show player names, shout encouragement — GREAT SHOT, SUPER BONUS — and display the high-score initials that motivated players to put in one more quarter. Speech synthesis chips arrived around the same time, and the combination of spoken words and readable text gave machines a personality that score reels never could.\n\nThe characteristic amber glow of a sixteen-segment display became the visual signature of an entire era: *High Speed*, *Earthshaker*, *Cyclone*, *Taxi*, *Bride of Pinbot*. The displays were capable of simple animations — scrolling text, flashing patterns — and designers used every available trick to suggest life within those glowing segments. When Williams introduced the first plasma dot-matrix display in 1991, the alphanumeric era ended almost immediately, but those segmented readouts remain instantly recognizable to anyone who spent time in an arcade during the 1980s."

    "description": "A handful of machines built in the late 1980s used an actual CGA computer monitor — the Color Graphics Adapter standard that powered early IBM PC compatibles — as their primary display. At 320×200 resolution with a four-color palette, or 640×200 in monochrome, CGA monitors could show crude but recognizable animations and video-game sequences that no segmented LED display could approximate. For a brief moment, pinball and the home computer occupied the same screen.\n\nBally's *Viper Night Drivin'* is the most notable example: a road-racing sequence played out on the CGA monitor while the physical playfield provided the tactile pinball experience. The effect was genuinely novel — a hybrid of video game and pinball that anticipated the multimedia machines of the following decade. Other manufacturers experimented with similar hybrid approaches, though none achieved wide commercial adoption.\n\nThe CGA display represents an evolutionary dead end, bypassed almost immediately by the plasma dot-matrix display that Williams introduced in 1991. Where CGA required a bulky cathode-ray tube and a dedicated video card, the DMD was purpose-built for pinball — lower cost, lower power, far more readable in the ambient light of an arcade. CGA pinball machines are rare today, their scarcity and oddity making them prized curiosities among collectors who appreciate the strange corners of the medium's history."

    "description": "In 1991, Williams introduced the plasma dot-matrix display on *Funhouse* and *The Addams Family*, and pinball changed overnight. A 128×32 grid of orange plasma dots, each one individually addressable, could show animations, character art, scrolling text, and simple video sequences at a speed and resolution that made alphanumeric displays look primitive by comparison. The DMD gave every machine a face.\n\nThe warm orange glow of a plasma DMD became as iconic as the score reel clatter had been a generation earlier. Designers used the display to extend licensed themes into the machine itself — *Twilight Zone*'s Gumball Machine, *Medieval Madness*'s castle siege, *Attack from Mars*'s alien invasion — creating a visual narrative layer that had never existed before. The dot count was low enough that animators developed a distinct aesthetic: chunky, high-contrast characters that read clearly from ten feet away under arcade lighting.\n\nWilliams and Bally dominated the DMD era, shipping machines that collectors now consider the pinnacle of the art form. Stern continued manufacturing DMD machines well into the 2010s even as competitors moved to LCD screens, and a devoted community of players still prefers the plasma display's analog warmth over modern HD panels. Color DMDs — aftermarket upgrades that replace the plasma tube with an LED matrix capable of full RGB color — have extended the display's life indefinitely, giving classics a vivid new look while preserving the original gameplay."

    "description": "The shift to LCD screens brought pinball into the HD era. Where a plasma DMD offered 128×32 pixels in a single orange color, a modern LCD backbox display runs at 1920×1080 or higher, capable of playing back video footage, layered animation, and real-time rendered graphics indistinguishable from a console game. Jersey Jack Pinball's *The Wizard of Oz* (2013) demonstrated what was possible; within a few years, large-format LCD panels had become the industry standard.\n\nStern, Spooky, American Pinball, and virtually every major manufacturer now ships machines with LCD displays ranging from 15 to 32 inches, often supplemented by secondary LCD panels on the playfield itself. Licensed themes that once required creative dot-matrix animation to suggest their source material can now show actual movie clips, television scenes, and studio-quality art. The backbox has become a full-resolution canvas.\n\nThe transition has not been without debate. Critics argue that high-definition video overwhelms the physical playfield, that the LCD screen's brightness and detail pull the eye away from the ball rather than complementing the action. Advocates counter that the medium should use every available technology, and that the best modern designers integrate display and playfield as a unified experience rather than two competing elements. The argument is ongoing — and entirely appropriate for a medium that has been arguing about its own nature since the first flipper appeared in 1947."
