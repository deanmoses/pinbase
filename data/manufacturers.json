    "description": "American Pinball entered the market in 2016 as a fresh challenger to the established order. Backed by the Polish Reh family — investors with deep roots in amusement machinery — the company set up operations in Chicago, inheriting the city's long tradition of pinball manufacturing. Their approach combined modern LCD display technology with an emphasis on value, offering feature-rich machines at a price point below the premium tier.\n\nTheir debut title, Houdini: Master of Mystery (2018), demonstrated a commitment to clever mechanical design and immersive theming. Subsequent releases including Oktoberfest (2019) and Legends of Valhalla (2022) built on that foundation, earning American Pinball a loyal following among operators and collectors who appreciate a thoughtfully engineered game at an accessible price."

    "description": "The name Atari conjures images of video game dominance, but for a brief period in the late 1970s the Silicon Valley giant made a serious push into pinball. Between 1976 and 1980, Atari produced roughly sixteen pinball titles, hoping to leverage its engineering talent and brand recognition in the coin-op amusement sector.\n\nThe results were mixed. Atari's machines featured innovative solid-state electronics — the company was an early adopter — but struggled to distinguish themselves in a market dominated by the established giants of Chicago. Titles like Superman (1979) and Hercules (1979) — the latter featuring an enormous 4-by-8-foot playfield — showed ambition but failed to find lasting commercial success. By 1980, Atari had exited pinball entirely to focus on its booming video game division. Their machines are now prized by collectors for their rarity and the novelty of the Atari name on a flipper game."

    "description": "Few names carry more weight in the history of pinball than Bally. Founded in 1931 by Raymond Moloney — who named the company after his breakthrough success, the Ballyhoo — Bally Manufacturing Corporation grew from a Chicago novelty shop operation into one of the most dominant forces in the amusement industry. For more than five decades, Bally machines set the standard for quality, innovation, and style.\n\nBally was a defining voice in the electromechanical era, producing iconic tables through the 1950s and 1960s and helping to normalize pinball as a fixture of arcades and taverns across America. The company's greatest technological leap came in 1977 with Freedom, widely credited as the first commercially successful solid-state pinball machine. That transition to microprocessors opened new frontiers in gameplay complexity, and Bally raced to exploit them — multiball, talking machines, and increasingly elaborate rule sets all followed in quick succession.\n\nIn 1988, Bally merged its pinball and amusement operations with those of Williams Electronics, forming WMS Industries. The two brands continued producing machines under their separate names — Bally tending toward licensed pop-culture themes, Williams toward complex gameplay — until WMS shuttered its pinball division in 1999. The Bally name was later licensed to Stern Pinball for use on a number of titles, a tribute to the brand's enduring resonance."

Partnering with a small US team, Capcom Coin-Op produced just eight pinball titles, each featuring the bright, character-driven aesthetics familiar from the company's gaming catalog.\n\nThe machines were technically proficient and featured art packages drawn directly from Capcom's properties. Titles like Pinball Magic (1995) and Big Bang Bar (1996) are now genuinely scarce — production runs were small, the venture was abandoned before it found its footing, and many machines were destroyed unsold. That rarity has made Capcom pins highly sought-after collector pieces, with Big Bang Bar in particular commanding remarkable prices among serious enthusiasts. The company's brief pinball chapter stands as a fascinating what-if in the hobby's history."

Titles like Medieval Madness Premium and Attack from Mars Premium deliver the essence of fan-favorite originals with the durability and consistency of a new machine.

Founded by David Gottlieb in Chicago in 1927, the company struck gold in 1931 with Baffle Ball, a simple but addictive game that sold thousands of units and transformed a novelty into a nationwide craze. Baffle Ball didn't just launch Gottlieb — it launched the modern amusement business.\n\nGottlieb remained at the forefront of innovation for decades. The company introduced Humpty Dumpty in 1947, the first pinball machine to feature flippers — a breakthrough that reframed the game from pure chance to skill, fundamentally altering its character and its relationship with anti-gambling legislation. In 1950, Gottlieb pioneered electronic scoring with Knock Out, replacing the clacking score reels that had defined the electromechanical era. Under chief designers including Ed Krynski and Gordon Hasse, Gottlieb built a reputation for clean, elegant gameplay and distinctive pastel-toned artwork.\n\nThe company was sold to Columbia Pictures Industries in 1977, beginning a series of ownership transitions that would ultimately prove fatal. Acquired by Premier Technology in 1984, then by Gottlieb's former workforce in a management buyout, the brand struggled through the 1990s as the market contracted. Production ceased in 1996, ending a run of nearly seven decades. The Gottlieb archive — spanning thousands of titles from Baffle Ball to Barb Wire — represents the most historically complete record of pinball's entire arc."

Titles like The Hobbit (2016), Dialed In! (2017), and Pirates of the Caribbean (2018) have been celebrated for their ambition, even as their complexity has drawn debate.

The company's P3 (Pinball 3) platform, introduced commercially in 2015, addressed this by creating a modular playfield system in which interchangeable upper playfield sections transform the game experience entirely. The lower playfield incorporates a high-resolution display beneath the playfield glass, enabling software-defined graphics to replace traditional physical inserts.\n\nThe P3 system represents the most ambitious rethinking of pinball's physical format in the solid-state era. A single P3 cabinet can host multiple game configurations through software and playfield module swaps, blurring the line between a traditional pinball machine and a programmable game platform. Multimorphic has positioned the P3 as both a consumer product and a development platform, attracting independent game designers who might not otherwise have the resources to manufacture an entirely original machine."

Sega Pinball's five-year run produced a catalog of licensed machines reflecting the company's brand relationships: GoldenEye (1996), Batman Forever (1995), Lost in Space (1998), and Harley-Davidson (1999) were among the titles.

The Twilight Zone. Medieval Madness. The Addams Family. Funhouse. Black Knight. The list of games that defined the hobby's highest aspirations runs through Williams like a spine.\n\nWilliams' design philosophy prized gameplay above all else: deep rule sets, satisfying physical feedback, and the sense that a player could spend a lifetime learning a table and still find new things to discover. Under designers including Steve Ritchie, Pat Lawlor, and Python Anghelo, Williams produced machine after machine that the pinball community has never stopped celebrating.\n\nIn 1988, Williams and Bally merged under the WMS Industries umbrella, with both brands continuing production under their separate names. The combination gave WMS remarkable market breadth and design resources. But even this powerhouse could not survive the catastrophic collapse of the coin-op amusement market in the late 1990s. The failure of Pinball 2000 — an ambitious video-pinball hybrid format launched in 1999 — was the final blow, and WMS shut its pinball division that year.

Gameplay was often inventive, with Zaccaria designers willing to experiment with unusual playfield layouts and mechanisms that their American counterparts rarely attempted.\n\nThe company's machines circulated primarily within Italy and Europe, but a dedicated international collector community has developed around them in the decades since Zaccaria ceased production in 1993. Today, Zaccaria pins are among the most sought-after European machines, and the brand has experienced a kind of afterlife through digital reproductions that have introduced a new generation to the company's remarkable legacy."
